.md is a markdown file. 
In general every project needs to have a README file  

### How to Upload Manually? 
In order to upload manually, RIGHT CLICK on the file, then go to Git, and then Select Add 
Ctrl + Alt + A is the shortcut 

### How do we tell if it has been uploaded/will be uploaded automatically?
In our IDLE, we are able to note this by seeing the name. For example, the file name README.md is green in colour, while the (currently) unsaved file 'Test2.py' is red. 


### How to add one more file?
To add one more file, click on the main repo name, which in this case is called 'Random. Choose the file type afterwards  

For 'Test2.py' file, we have to configure the Python Intepretor for the project. We do that by doing 
File > Settings > Add python intepretor (but in this case its working so we wont)

### How to run a file (not the whole thing)
Run > Run > Select Which File you wish to run 

### To see files which are ready to be committed 
Commit => The saving of a snapshot of changes to the Version Control System (VCS) 
Click the Commit 'icon', which is just a circle with a line passing inbetweem 
Click on the box so it will be ticked 
We will write our commit message, and then you will have two options namely commit/commit and push to repository 
Once it is pushed, it can be seen on Github 

### How to ensure that files which were made on Github can also be updated simultaneously into your IDLE?
We will use the hotkey for Update Project (Ctrl + T) download the latest version 

### Potential Issues/Unresolved Questions 
How do I have a file on my local IDLE, and not have it automatically be uploaded into GitHub? 
If we want to ignore say ALL pdf files, we do *.pdf 

### How to Push a File? 
In order to push a file, right click on File Name, click GIt, and then you have the option to Push (Send it to Github) or Pull (Retrieve the latest version from Github)

### How do we create branches and work on them, together with pushing to the repo 
Click on Git (Bottom Left/Alt + 9). Under 'Local' there should be a file name. Right click on it and click New Branch from Selected/<Name> 
Branches allow you to work independently/create different workflows without modifying the one in the original branch
Changes made in the 'Development' branch will not affect the one in the 'main' branch 

Q: What if there are commits in development branch which you want to appear in the master branch?
We can choose to MERGE both branches together. Click on the development branch,  

### How to make the changes in development branch (another branch) appear in the master branch?
We will have to merge the branches together. If we wish to make the changes appear in the master branch, we right click on the development branch
